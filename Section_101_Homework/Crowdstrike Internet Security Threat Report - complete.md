## Part I: Crowdstrike 2021 Global Threat Report
#### For Part 1 of your homework assignment, use the Crowdstrike 2021 Global Threat Report along with independent research to answer the following questions.
________________________________________
1.	What was the dominant ransomware family that impacted the healthcare industry in 2020?
    * **Maze**

2.	Describe three different pandemic-related eCrime Phishing themes.
    * **Impersonating medical organizations (WHO or CDC).**
    * **Scams offering Personal Protective Equipment.**
    * **Appearing to offer information about financial assistance and stimulus packages.**

3.	Which industry was targeted with the highest number of ransomware-associated data extortion operations?
    * **Industrial and Engineering Sector**

4.	What is WICKED PANDA? Where do they originate from?
    * **A Threat Actor that targets telecommunication primarily, they are from China.**

5.	Which ransomware actor was the first observed using data extortion in a ransomware campaign?
    * **OUTLAW SPIDER**

6.	What is an access broker? 
    * **Someone who has quietly attained access to a network though a variety of means and sells that access to a potential threat actor.**

7.	Explain a credential-based attack.
    * **Attackers will scour social media to determine who insides and organization would have the access level to the information they seek.  They then use targeted phishing attacks (sometimes called ‘spear phishing’) to steal these credentials allowing them to bypass the organization security and gain access to the information they seek.**

8.	Who is credited for the heavy adoption of data extortion in ransomware campaigns?
    * **TWISTED SPIDER**

9.	What is a DLS?
    * Dedicated Leak Sites – used by ransomware attackers to leak a targets sensitive information to extort them into payment. A way to get around orgs using backups to combat data encryption ransomware attacks.**

10.	According to Crowdstrike Falcon OverWatch, what percentage of intrusions came from eCrime intrusions in 2020? 
    * **79%**

11.	Who was the most reported criminal adversary of 2020? 
    * **WIZARD SPIDER**

12.	Explain how SPRITE SPIDER and CARBON SPIDER impacted virtualization infrastructures.
    * **They began to target virtual networks using harvested admin level credentials. This allowed them to more quickly and easily deploy ransomware across multiple systems by targeting the hypervisor (ESXi). Because more companies have began using virtualization solutions to consolidate legacy systems, this created a natural target. A big issue is that ESXi doesn’t have endpoint security which could detect these attacks and perhaps prevent them.**

13.	What role does an Enabler play in an eCrime ecosystem?
    * **They can various roles. Either they sell malware through MaaS operations.  They my create and distribute delivery mechanisms, or they act as Initial Access Brokers though network exploits.**

 
14.	What are the three parts of the eCrime ecosystem that CrowdStrike highlighted in their report?
    * **Services (Access Brokers)**
    * **Distribution (BGH, Phishing, Spear Phishing)**
    * **Monetization (Ransom Payments)**
	
15.	What is the name of the malicious code used to exploit a vulnerability in the SolarWinds Orion IT management software?
    * **SUNBURST**
