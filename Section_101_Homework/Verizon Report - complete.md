# Security 101 Homework: Cybersecurity Threat Landscape 
## Part 3: Verizon Data Breaches Investigation Report
#### In this part, use the Verizon Data Breaches Investigation Report plus independent research to answer the below questions.
______________________________________________________________________
1.	What is the difference between an incident and a breach? 
    * **An ‘Incident’ is an event that effects CIA (confidentiality, Integrity, availability) of an information asset, where as a ‘Breach’ is a confirmed release of data to actors that shouldn’t have it.**

2.	What percentage of breaches were perpetrated by outside actors? What percentage were perpetrated by internal actors? 
    * **Nearly 75% - EXTERNAL, About 25% - INTERNAL**

3.	What percentage of breaches were perpetrated by organized crime? 
    * **About 80%**

4.	What percentage of breaches were financially motivated?
    * **About 90%**

5.	Define the following (Additional research may be required outside of the report): 
    * **Denial of Service:** 
        - A form of attack meant to disable a network or machine rendering its services unavailable to its intended users. Usually this is accomplished through targeting the network or machine with internet traffic meant to overload the network or containing malicious software that crashes the machine.
    * **Command and Control:**
        * These are servers used by malicious actors to send commands to malware infected systems on a network and receive and store data that has been stolen from a network.
    * **Backdoor:**
        * A way for a user, both malicious and otherwise, to gain access to a system by circumventing normal security. These are generally discreet and undocumented and most of the time built into the software or hardware by developers or sometimes inserted discreetly by bad actors.
    * **Keylogger:**
        * A form of software (often malware) or a hardware device, that records the keystrokes a user puts into their keyboard. Most often this is used to gain user credentials to later be used for unauthorized access to accounts and networks.  They do have legitimate uses in some organizations as a way for IT to track user activity.

6.	What remains one of the most sought-after data types for hackers? 
    * **Credentials**

7.	What was the percentage of breaches involving phishing?
    * **36%**
