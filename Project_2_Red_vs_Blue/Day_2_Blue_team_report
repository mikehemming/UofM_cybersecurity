After creating your dashboard and becoming familiar with the search syntax, use these tools to answer the questions below:


## Identify the offensive traffic.

1) Identify the traffic between your machine and the web machine:

    - When did the interaction occur?
        - The interaction began around 00:00UDT, May 10th, 2022 and ended around 02:15UDT on May 10th, 2022.
    - What responses did the victim send back?
        - 401 on initial GET request to /secret/folder, along with 301, 207, 404, and 200 responses on queries to the webdav directory.
    - What data is concerning from the Blue Team perspective?
        - There is a large spike in the connections over time just after 0030UDT with traffic spiking to nearly 20,000 unique connections. This could be a DDOS attack or in our case, the brute force attack to break the password on the secret folder directory.




## Find the request for the hidden directory.

2) In your attack, you found a secret folder. Let's look at that interaction between these two machines.

    - How many requests were made to this directory? At what time and from which IP address(es)?
        - The folder /company_folders/secret_folder was accessed 17,182 times.
    - Which files were requested? 
        - connect_to_corp_server was accessed 2 times.
    - What information did they contain?
        - instructions to access the webdav server.
    - What kind of alarm would you set to detect this behavior in the future?
        - I would set an alert if to go off anytime the /secret_folder/ directory or connect_to_corp_server was accessed
    - Identify at least one way to harden the vulnerable machine that would mitigate this attack.
        - I would take these off a public facing server.





Identify the brute force attack.

After identifying the hidden directory, you used Hydra to brute-force the target server. Answer the following questions:

Can you identify packets specifically from Hydra?
How many requests were made in the brute-force attack?
How many requests had the attacker made before discovering the correct password in this one?
What kind of alarm would you set to detect this behavior in the future and at what threshold(s)?
Identify at least one way to harden the vulnerable machine that would mitigate this attack.





Find the WebDav connection.

Use your dashboard to answer the following questions:

How many requests were made to this directory?
Which file(s) were requested?
What kind of alarm would you set to detect such access in the future?
Identify at least one way to harden the vulnerable machine that would mitigate this attack.





Identify the reverse shell and meterpreter traffic.

To finish off the attack, you uploaded a PHP reverse shell and started a meterpreter shell session. Answer the following questions:

Can you identify traffic from the meterpreter session?
What kinds of alarms would you set to detect this behavior in the future?
Identify at least one way to harden the vulnerable machine that would mitigate this attack.
