3-At their basic level, programming languages are intended to take human input and convert to usable data for a computer. The IT landscape is huge and since no single language can do everything, programmers have developed their own languages based on personal preference and the requirements of the task or industry. This has led to countless different languages, many obscure but several that have found enough of a community of users and usefullness in certain industries that they become popular and widespread. A developers preference will determine greatly on their preferred style and the industry they choose to work in. A game developer will use a different set of languages then a web application developer or someone developing a business or education application.

Part 2

I would like to improve my base of knowledge so that I have a solid foundation to continue to improve and develop my skills. Much of my IT knowledge is self taught so I lack some of the best practices and tools that traditionally taught individuals might have. I have a very strong criminal justice and investigatory background so the forensics aspects of cybersecurity I find very interesting. Investigating a breach, determining how the exploit occurred and helping to figure out measures to combat future attacks sounds appealing. I do not have a current carreer in cybersecurity but my skills as a SysAdmin and network security give me a solid framework to learn and improve upon. I hope to use this course as a way to pivot into a new career field and reinvigorate my desire to learn as well as find a new field for which I can be passionate about.
