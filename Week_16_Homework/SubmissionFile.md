### Step 5: Zenmap

Your client has asked that you help identify any vulnerabilities with their file-sharing server. Using the Metasploitable machine to act as your client's server, complete the following:

- Command for Zenmap to run a service scan against the Metasploitable machine: 
    - nmap -T4 -F 192.168.0.10
 
- Bonus command to output results into a new text file named `zenmapscan.txt`:
    - nmap -T4 -F -oN zenmapscan.txt 192.168.0.10

- Zenmap vulnerability script command:
    - nmap -T4 -A -v --script smb-enum-shares

- Once you have identified this vulnerability, answer the following questions for your client:
  1. What is the vulnerability:
   - Samba 3.0.20-Debian (Samba'Username map script' Command Execution)

  2. Why is it dangerous:
   - Attackers can cause remote command execution through using username script mapping, adjusting the username to contain additional characters and execute code.

  3. What mitigation strategies can you recommendations for the client to protect their server:
   - Update Samba to versions later than 3.0.25rc3.
   - Remove Samba protocols and use SSH for remote access.
